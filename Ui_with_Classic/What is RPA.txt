What is Robotic Process Automation?

Robotic Process Automation is the 
technology that allows anyone today to 
configure computer software, or a “robot” 
to emulate and integrate the actions 
of a human interacting within digital systems
 to execute a business process. RPA robots 
utilize the user interface to capture data and
 manipulate applications just like humans do. 
They interpret, trigger responses and communicate with 
other systems in order to perform on a vast variety of repetitive tasks. 
Only substantially better: an RPA software robot never sleeps, makes zero mistakes and costs a lot less than an employee
